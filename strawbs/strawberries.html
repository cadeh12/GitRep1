        <p class="standard">Basic considerations when locating a strawberry patch include:</p>
        <ul class="standard">
            <li>Full sun</li>
            <li>Well drained, sandy loam with a soil pH from 5.8 to 6.2 is ideal</li>
            <li>Don't plant where tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, or eggplant have been grown recently</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="standard">Start with a rich, organic soil. Apply a balanced fertilizer (10-10-10) at planting at the rate of one pound per 100 sq. ft. Fertilize again after renovation of June bearers or second harvest of day neutrals and everbearing types. Do not over fertilizer or you will have excessive leaf growth and poor flowering. Do not fertilizer strawberries late in the season in colder climate to prevent growth that will be damaged by frost.</p>
